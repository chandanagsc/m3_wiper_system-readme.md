Wiper is an essential component that used to wipe the raindrops or any water from the windscreen. Wipers are designed
and made to clear the water from a windscreen. Most of cars have two wipers on the windscreen, one on the rear
window and the other on each headlight. The wiper parts visible from outside the car are the rubber blade, the wiper
arm holding the blade, a spring linkage, and parts of the wiper pivots. The wiper itself has about six parts called
pressure points or claws that are small arms under the wiper.
Existing system manually used control stalk to activate wiper and the process of pulling up wiper is difficult to be
handled. The driver needs to switch on and off the control stalk and it will reduce the driverâ€™s concentration during the
driving. Thus, this system is proposed to solve all these problems. The concept of this wiper system is similar with
other conventional wiper, yet this system will be upgraded to an automatic control system by using a controller.
Whenever the water hit a dedicated sensor that located on windscreen, it will send a signal to move on the wiper motor.
Once water is not detected by sensor, the wiper will automatically stop. This will help the driver to give more
concentration and reduce the car accident probability
